# ImageSearch

This is Angular 6 single page app for image searching. App uses [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) API for getting the images. I got the idea for this project from [Coding Garden's livestream](https://youtu.be/qQGPpUmDSPI). Here I also implemented some of his "homework" tasks such as adding/removing images to favourites and next and back buttons to navigate between results.   
For styling I used CSS framework [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).

## How to use

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
